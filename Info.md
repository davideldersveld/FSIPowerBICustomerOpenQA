Thursdays at 1:30pm Eastern to 2:20pm Eastern

This time is open Q&A for any Microsoft US Financial Services customer. Bring product, pre-sales, licensing, adoption, and any other "what or why" questions related to Power BI.

Although we can't cover the scope of "how to" during this time, we can discuss how to accelerate any POC, project, or training needed through Microsoft or Microsoft partners.
